👋🏾 Hi, I’m @mrunalimanj! 
* I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student in the Coley Research Group at MIT as part of the Computational and Systems Biology Program. I'm (very) broadly interested in biology- and chemistry-informed modeling for challenges in functional molecular design and discovery (from small molecules to proteins) that can best be served by, or in some cases, be complementary to, high-throughput data collection. 🤿
* Previously, I was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where I studied Bioengineering and EECS; and worked on problems in computational methods for protein fitness. 🧸
